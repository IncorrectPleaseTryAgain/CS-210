# Cpp_Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project sorts an input file full of items into an output 
file that contains every item and their frequency. The user then 
chooses from three different options which includes displaying the 
output file, display the frequency for a specific item, and displaying
a histogram for the items and their respected frequency.

This project solves the problem of using two diffirent programing
languages in a single program. This project uses C++ to get user input
and to display to the terminal (frontend). This project uses Python 3 to
read the input file, sort the data, and write to the output file (backend).

#What did you do particularly well?

In this project I was proficient in testing and making sure that user
input would be validated. The code structure and it's functionality was
done well, thus it is optimized with time and space complexity.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient,
secure, and so on?


#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
